# TO DO:

- server
- adaptive
- account page
- minify (webpack)
- cookie alert
- move images inside the component
- print.scss - move specific styles inside the component
- rename color vars

- remove dependencies from components, but use 'script manager' to control them (e.g. when menu opens -> close modal by using a dispatch)
